This drawing is a 3D design of a gear. The following tools were used within the program for measuring:

1. *Measurement Tool*:
- Spaces between provisions, points and faces, as well as trains and parts.
- Accessible from the toolbar, it allows the measurements to be displayed directly on the screen.

2. *Dimension Tool*:
- So far I have drawn the dimensions of air lines, angles and distances.

3. *Dynamic Measurement*:
- During creation or modification, the program displays the measurements dynamically when selecting elements.
